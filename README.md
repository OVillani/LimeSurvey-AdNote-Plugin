# Purpose
Sometimes it is a good idea to keep some information for questions for the long run.
In some cases it is helpful to have a todo-list when a survey cannot be edited at once.
So this plugin helps for documentation and workflow within the survey and without (or less) external documents.


# Installation
Downlod via githb, unzip and place the folder 'addNotes' and its content within the /Limesurvey/plugins/ folder.
Don't forget to activate the plugin in the Plugin manager (Configuration > Settings > Plugin manager).

# Roadmap and Ideas
- Add a summary for todo's somewhere (e.g. in survey plugin settings)
