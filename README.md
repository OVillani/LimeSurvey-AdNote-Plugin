# LimeSurvey-AddNote-Plugin
A plugin for LimeSurvey 3.0 and later - easily add notes and todo's to your questions


# Purpose
Sometimes it is a good idea to keep some information for questions for the long run.
In some cases it is helpful to have a todo-list when a survey cannot be edited at once.
So this plugin helps for documentation within the survey.
